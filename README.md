This project will use the AEA Schedule to measure gender differences at the Annual AEA meetings. An example of the schedule is here: https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2019/preliminary

We've paid someone to parse the data into readable csv format. The 2019 data is available under the `data/` folder.
